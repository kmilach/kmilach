# Hello World!

Hi, everyone! My name is Kelvin and I work as a Cybersecurity Analyst in :brazil: Brazil.

I love learning about many areas of InfoSec, such as incident response, forensics and SecOps.

Currently, I aim to improve my scripting skills, be it ```Python``` or ```PowerShell```, so as to automate many of the tasks I manually do or simply for fun!
